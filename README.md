## Chapter 3 - Your first assembly program

*	[exit.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/exit.s)  -  a first assembly program showing the functionality of the exit() syscall
*	[maximum.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/maximum.s)  -  finding the largest number in a data index
*	[minimum.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/minimum.s)  -  finding the smallest number in a data index

## Chapter 4 - Functions

*	[power.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/power.s)  -  illustrating how functions work by solving 2^3 + 5^2
*	[factorial.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/factorial.s)  -  solving a factorial by creating a function
*	[square.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/square.s)  -  solving a square x^2 = ? by creating a function

## Chapter 5 - Buffers & File Descriptors
*	[toupper.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%205/toupper.s)  -  using buffers and file descriptors to change all lowercase letters of a file to all uppercase letters

## Chapter 6 - Reading and Writing Simple Records:

*	[linux.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/linux.s)  -  common Linux definitions use .equ including syscalls, file descriptors, status codes, interrupts
*	[record-def.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/record-def.s)  -  record offsets  
*	[add-year.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/add-year.s)  -  add a year to each record
*	[count-chars.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/count-chars.s)  -  function to count the number of characters in a record
*	[read-record.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/read-record.s)  -  function to read a record
*	[read-records.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/read-records.s)  -  final program to read all the records
*	[write-newline.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-newline.s)  -  function to write a newline to STDOUT
*	[write-record.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-record.s)  -  function to write in a record
*	[write-records.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-records.s)  -  final program to write all the records
