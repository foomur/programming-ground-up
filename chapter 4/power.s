#PURPOSE: 		Program to illustrate how functions work
# 			This program will compute the value of 2^3 + 5^2
 				  
#			Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
#			so the data section doesn’t have anything.

#PURPOSE: 		This function is used to compute the value of a number raised to a power
 				   				
#INPUT: 	  	First argument - the base number
# 			Second argument - the power to raise it to
# 				   

#OUTPUT: 		Will give the result as a return value

#NOTES: 		The power must be 1 or greater

#VARIABLES:
# 			%ebx - holds the base number
# 			%ecx - holds the power
# 			-4(%ebp) - holds the current result
# 			%eax is used for temporary storage
